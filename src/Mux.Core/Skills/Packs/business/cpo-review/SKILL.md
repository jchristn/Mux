# /cpo-review, CPO Forcing Questions

**Command:** `/cpo-review <plan>`

The JTBD-driven builder cuts the roadmap in half. Six questions to surface what to ship and what to kill.

## When to Run

- Before quarterly roadmap commitment
- Before launching a new product line
- Before adding > 3 features to a release
- When retention is flat or declining
- When the team is debating "should we build X?"

## The Six CPO Questions

### 1. JTBD
**What job is this feature hired to do, in the user's words?**
- Not "improve onboarding." "Help a new ops manager get their first deal closed within 7 days."
- Job ≠ feature. Hire ≠ try.

### 2. North Star Metric
**What user behavior does this move, and how does that ladder to the North Star?**
- The metric must be leading, behavior-based, and value-correlated.
- If you can't trace the feature to the North Star, don't build it.

### 3. PMF Signal
**What's the retention curve for users who hire this job, is it flat, decaying, or smiling?**
- Flat or smiling = PMF signal. Decaying = no PMF.
- "Users like it in surveys" is not a signal.

### 4. RICE Score
**Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort, what's the score and where does this rank in the queue?**
```bash
python product-team/skills/product-manager-toolkit/scripts/rice_prioritizer.py
```

### 5. Opportunity Cost
**What gets cut if this ships? Name the specific initiative or feature.**
- Headcount and time are zero-sum. The cut list is the focus list.

### 6. Kill Criteria
**What signal would tell you in 90 days that this was the wrong bet?**
- Define the metric and threshold in writing, before launch.
- If you can't define a kill criterion, you can't ship responsibly.

## Workflow

1. **Run the analyses:**
   ```bash
   python3 "${SKILL_DIR}/shared/c-level-advisor/skills/cpo-advisor/scripts/pmf_scorer.py"
   python3 "${SKILL_DIR}/shared/c-level-advisor/skills/cpo-advisor/scripts/portfolio_analyzer.py"
   ```
2. **Answer the six questions.**
3. **Apply the verdict.**

## Output Format

```markdown
# CPO Review: <feature/plan>
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## JTBD
> <one sentence in user voice>

## North Star Link
- Metric moved: <name>
- Expected delta: <%>

## PMF Signal
- Retention curve shape: flat / smiling / decaying
- Cohort sample size: N

## Score
- RICE: <number>
- Rank in queue: #N of M

## Cut List
- Cut: <initiative>
- Reason: <why this matters more>

## Kill Criteria (90 days)
- Metric: <name>
- Threshold: <value>
- Action if missed: <kill | iterate>

## Verdict
🟢 SHIP | 🟡 SHARPEN | 🔴 KILL
```

## Routing

- `/cmo-review`, does the positioning support this feature?
- `/exec-execute`, build the 90-day plan
- `/exec-post-mortem`, if kill criteria triggered
